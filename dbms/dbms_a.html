                    , and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded this data in an indexed address book
                    or may have
                    have stored it on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access or

                    A Database Management System stores data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve,
                    manipulate and produce information.
                    The DBMS is a general-purpose-software-system that facilitates the process of defining,
                    constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among
                    various users and applications. Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures,
                    and constraints of the data to be stored in the
                    database.</p>

                <h5 class="h2-head" id="b">Characteristics of DBMS:</h5>
                <P class="p-para">
                    Traditionally, data was organised in file formats. DBMS was a new concept then, and all research was
                    done to make it overcome
                    the deficiencies in traditional style of data management. A modern DBMS has the following
                    characteristics -
                </P>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Read-World Entity:</b> A modern DBMS is more realistic and users real-world entities to
                        design its architecture. It
                        uses the behaviour and attributes too. For example, a school database may use students as an
                        entity and their age as
                        an attribute.</li>
                    <li><b>Relational-bsed tables:</b> DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. A
                        user can understand the
                        architecture of a databse just by looking at the table names.</li>
                    <li><b>Isolation of data & application:</b> A database system is entirely different than its data. A
                        Database is an active entity,
                        whereas data is said to be passive , on which the database works and organise. DBMS also stores
                        metadata, which is data about data,
                        to ease its own process.</li>
                    <li><b>Less Redundancy:</b> DBMS follows the rule of Normalization, which splits a relation when any
                        of its attributes is having
                        redundancy in values. Normalization is a mathematically a rich and scientific process that
                        reduce data redundancy. </li>
                    <li><b>Consistency:</b> Consistency is a state where every relation in a database remains
                        consistent. There exist methods and
                        techniques , which can detect attempt of leaving database in inconsistent state. A DBMS can
                        provide greater consistency
                        as compared to earlier forms of data storing applications like file-processing systems.</li>
                    <li><b>Query Language:</b> DBMS is equipped with query language, which makes it more efficient to
                        retrieve and manipulate data.
                        A user can apply as many and as different filtering options as required to retrieve a set of
                        data. Traditionally it was not
                        possible where file-processing system was used.</li>
                    <li><b>ACID Properties:</b> DBMS follows the concept of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation &
                        Durability (normally shortened as ACID).
                        These concepts are applied on transactions, which manipulate data in a database</li>
                    <li><b>Multiuser and Concurrent Access:</b> DBMS supports multi-user environment and allows them to
                        access and manipulate data in parallel.
                        Through there are restrictions on transactions when users attempt to handle the same data item,
                        but users are always unaware of them.</li>
                    <li><b>Multiple View: </b> DBMS offers multiple views for different users. A user who is in the
                        sales department will have a different view of
                        database than a person working in the Production department. This feature enables the users to
                        have a concentrate view of database according
                        to their requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Security:</b> DBMS offers methods to impose constraints while entering data into the database
                        and retrieving the same at a later stage.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5 class="h2-head" id="d">Types of Users:</h5>
                <p class="p-para">
                    A typical DBMS has users with different rights and permissions who use it for different purposes.
                    Some users retrieve data and some back it up.
                    The users of a DBMS can be broadly categorized as follows-</p>
                <img src="./dbms-img/Typesofusers.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                <b><u>Administrators:</u></b>
                <p class="p-para"> Administrators maintain the DBMS and are responsible for administration the database.
                    They are responsible to look after its usage and by whom
                    it should be used. They create access profiles for users and apply limitations to maintain isolation
                    and force security. Administrators also look after DBMS
                    resources like system license, required tools, and other software and hardware related maintainence.
                </p>
                <b><u>Designers:</u></b>
                <p class="p-para">Designers are the group of people who actually work on the designing part of the
                    database. They keep a close watch on what data should be kept in what format. They identify and
                    design the
                    whole set of entities, relations, constraints, and views.</p>
                <b><u>End Users:</u></b>
                <p class="p-para">End users are those actually reap the benefits of having a DBMS. End Users can range
                    from simple viewers who pay attention to the logs or market rates to sophisticated users such as
                    business analysts.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5 class="h2-head" id="c">Database Architecture</h5>
                <p class="p-para">The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or
                    hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier. An n-tier
                    architecture divides the whole system
                    into related but independent n modules, which can be independently modified, altered, changed, or
                    replaced.</p>
                <p class="p-para">In 1-tier architecture, the DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on
                    the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will directly be done on the DBMS itself. It does not
                    provide handy tools for end-users.
                    Database designers and programmers normally prefer to use single-tier architecture.</p>
                <p class="p-para">If the architecture of DBMS is 2-tier, then it must have an application through which
                    the DBMS can be accessed. Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of
                    an application. Here the application
                    tier is entirely independent of the database in terms of operation, design, and programming. </p>
                <p class="p-para"><b>3-tier Architecture:</b> A 3-tier Architecture separates its tiers from each other
                    based on the complexity of the users and how they use the data present in the database. It is the
                    most widely used architecture to
                    design a DBMS.</p>
                <img source=""></img>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Database(Data) Tier-</b> At this tier, the database resides along with its query processing
                        languages. We also have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Application(Middle) Tier-</b> At this tier reside the application serve and the programs that
                        access the database. For a user, this application tier presents an abstracted view of the
                        database. End-users are unaware of any existence of the database beyond the application.
                        At the other end, the database tier is not aware of any other user beyond the application tier.
                        Hence, the application layer sits in the middle and acts as a mediator between the end-user and
                        the database.</li>
                    <li><b>User(Presentation) Tier-</b> End-Users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any
                        existence of the database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can
                        be provided by the application.
                        All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="h2-head">Database Schema:</h5>
                <p class="p-para"></p>A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of
                the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are
                associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied
                on the data.
                <p class="p-para"> A database schema defines its entities and the relationship among them. It contains a
                    descriptive detail of the database, which can be depicted by means of schema diagrams. It's the
                    database designers who design the schema to help programmers understand the
                    database and make it useful.</p>
                <img src="">
                <p class="p-para"> A database schema can be divided broadly into two categories-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Physical Database Schema:</b> This schema pertains to the actual storage of data and its form
                        of storage like files, indices, etc. It defines how the data will be stored in a secondary
                        storage. </li>
                    <li><b>Logical Database Schema:</b> This schema defines all the logical constraints that need to be
                        applied on the data stored. It defines tables, views, and integrity constraints.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5 class="h2-head" id="e">Database Instance & Independence:</h5>
                <p class="p-para"><b><u>Database Instance:</u></b></p>
                <p class="p-para">It is important that we distinguish these two terms individually. Databbase schema is
                    the skeleton of database. It is designed when the database doesn't exist at all. Once the database
                    is operational, it is very difficult to
                    make any changes to it. A database schema does not contain any data or information.</p>
                <p class="p-para">A database instance is a state of operational database with data at any given time. It
                    contains a snapshot of the database. Database instances tend to change with time. A DBMS ensures
                    that its every instance (state) is in a valid state, by diligently following all
                    the validations, constraints, and consitions that the database designers have imposed.</p>
                <p class="p-para">If a database system is not multi-layered, then it becomes difficult to make any
                    changes in the database system. Database systems are designed in multi-layered as we learnt earlier.
                </p>
                <p class="p-para"><b><u>Data Independence:</u></b></p>
                <p class="p-para">A database system normally contains a lot of data in addition to users' data. For
                    example, it stores data about data, known as metadata, to locate and retrieve data easily. It is
                    rather difficult to modify and update
                    a set of metadata once it is stored in the database. But as a DBMS expands, it needs to change over
                    time to satisfy the requirements of the users. If the entire data is dependent, it would become a
                    tedious and highly complex job.</p>
                <img src="./dbms-img/dataindependence.jpg" height="400" width="700">
                <p class="p-para">Metadata itself follows a layered architecture, so that when we change data one layer,
                    it does not affect data at another level. The data is independent but mapped to each other.</p>
                <p class="p-para"><b>Logical Data Independence:</b> Logical data is data about database, that is, it
                    stores information about how data is managed inside. For example, a table(relation) stored in the
                    database and all its constraints, applied on that relation.</p>
                <p class="p-para">Logical data independence is a kind of mechanism, which liberalizes itself from actual
                    data stored on the disk. If we do some changes on table format, it should not change the data
                    residing on the disk.</p>
