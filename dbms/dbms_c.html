                    denoted by X-Y, between two sets of attributes X and Y that are subsets of R specifies a constraint on the possible tuple that can 
                    form a relation state r of R. The constraint is that, for any two tuples t1 and t2 in r that have t1[X]=t2[X], they must also have 
                    t1[Y]=t2[Y]. This means that the value of Y components of a tuple in r depend on, or are determined by, the values of the X component; 
                    alternatively, the values of the X component, of a tuple uniquely determine the values of the Y component. We also say that there is a 
                    functional dependency from X to Y, or that Y is functional dependent on X. </p>

                    <li>Normalization reduces redundancy by organizing data into multiple related tables, each containing a single subject, and establishing relationships between them.</li>
                    <li>Normalization helps enforce consistency by ensuring that each piece of information is stored in only one place.</li>
                    <li>Normalization makes it easier to update and modify data without risking inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li>While normalization may result in more tables and more complex queries, it can also improve database performance in certain situations.</li>
                    <li>Normalization is essential for maintaining data integrity, consistency, and efficiency in a relational database management system.</li>

                <p class="p-para">We present the first three normal forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF. These were proposed by Codd (1972a) as a sequence to achieve the desirable 
                    state of 3NF relations by progressing through the intermediate states of 1NF and 2NF if needed. As we shall see, 2NF and 3NF attack different problems.
                    However, for historical reasons, it is customary to follow them in that sequence; hence by definition a 3NF relation already satisfies 2NF.</p>
                <p class="p-para"><b><u>First Normal Form(1NF):</u></b></p>
                <p class="p-para">The first normal forms states that the domain of an attribute must include only atomic (single, indivisible) values and that the value of any 
                    attribute in a tuple must be a single value from the domain of the attribute. Hence, 1NF disallows having a set of values, a tuple of values, or a combination of 
                    both as an attribute value for a single tuple. In other words, 1NF disallows relations within relations or relations as attribute values within tuples. The only attribute 
                    values permitted by 1NF are single atomic values.</p>
