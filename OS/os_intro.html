                <p class="p-para"> An operating system (OS) is a software that acts as an intermediary between computer
                    hardware and user applications.
                    It manages hardware resources and provides services to software applications, allowing them to run
                    efficiently and interact with the hardware.
                    The operating system performs various essential functions including process management, memory
                    management, file system management, device management, user interface management, and security
                    management.
                <p>Overall, the operating system plays a crucial role in facilitating the operation of a computer
                    system, enabling users to interact with the hardware and run software applications effectively. </p>

                    <p>Scheduling in operating systems refers to the process of allocating system resources to different
                        tasks or processes
                        over time. It involves deciding which process should run when, how long it should run, and in
                        what order. Scheduling
                        is a fundamental concept in operating systems and plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient
                        utilization of system
                        resources, improving system performance, and providing a responsive user experience.</p>

                    <p>
                        A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is
                        waiting for a resource
                        held by another process in the same set. In other words, each process is stuck waiting for a
                        resource that is held by another
                        process, causing a circular dependency that prevents any of the processes from making progress.
                        Deadlocks are a type of resource
                        allocation issue that can occur in systems with multiple processes competing for shared
                        resource.</p>

                    <p>
                        Memory management in an operating system (OS) is the process of efficiently and effectively
                        managing the computer's
                        memory resources, ensuring that processes and programs can execute smoothly while maximizing the
                        utilization of
                        available memory. Memory management involves various tasks, including allocation, deallocation,
                        protection, and
                        sharing of memory resources.

                    <p>
                        A file management system in an operating system is a software component responsible for managing
                        files and
                        directories on a computer's storage devices. It provides a way for users and programs to create,
                        access, modify,
                        and organize files and folders efficiently. The file management system handles tasks such as
                        file creation, deletion,
                        copying, moving, renaming, and searching.
