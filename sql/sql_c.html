            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="p-para"> There are five types of SQL Commands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>DQL:</b> DQL stands for "Data Query Language" that is used to retrieve data from
                            databases. The SELECT statement is
                            the foundation of DQL and allows us to extract specific columns from a table.</p>
                        <p>Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, .... fROM table_name;</p>
                        <p>Here column1, column2.. are the fields names of the table.</p>
                        <p>If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:</p>
                        <p>SELECT*FROM table_name;</p>
                        <p>Example: SELECT customername, city FROM costumers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>DDL:</b> DDL stands for "Data Definition Language", is a subset of SQL(Structured Query
                            Language) responsible for
                            defining and managing the structure of databases and their objects.</p>
                        <p>DDL Commands enable you to create, modify, and delete databse objects like tables, indexes,
                            constraints, and more.</p>
                        <p>Key DDL commands are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>CREATE TABLE:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Used to create a new table in the database.</li>
                                    <li>Specifies the table name, colimn names, data types, constraints and more.</li>
                                    <li>Example- CREATE TABLE employees(id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), salary
                                        DECIMAL(10,2));</li>

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>ALTER TABLE:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Used to modify the structure of an existing table.</li>
                                    <li>You can add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, and more.</li>
                                    <li>Example- ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>DROP TABLE:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Used to delete an existing table along with its data and structure.</li>
                                    <li>Example- DROP TABLE employees;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>TRUNCATE TABLE:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.</li>
                                    <li>Example- TRUNCATE TABLE table_name</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>DML:</b> DML stands for "Data Manipulation Language" that is used to manipulate the data
                            within the database.
                            DML allows you to insert, update, and delete records, ensuring the accuracy and currency of
                            your data.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>INSERT:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The INSERT statement adds new records to a table.</li>
                                    <li>Syntax- INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2,...) VALUES(value1, value2,
                                        ...);</li>
                                    <li>Example- INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES ('Aditya',
                                        'Pratap', 50000);</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>UPDATE: </b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The UPDATE statement modifies existing records in a table.</li>
                                    <li>Syntax- UPDATE table_name SET column1=value1, column2=value2, ... WHERE
                                        condition;</li>
                                    <li>Example- UPDATE employees SET salary=55000 WHERE first_name='Aditya';</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>DELETE:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The DELETE statement removes records from a table.</li>
                                    <li>Syntax- DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;</li>
                                    <li>Example- DELETE FROM employees WHERE last_name='Pratap'</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>DCL</b> DCL stands for Data Control Language that focuses on the management of access
                            rights, permissions, and security-related aspects of a database system.</p>
                        <p>DCL commands are used to control who can access the data, modify the data, or perform
                            administrative tasks within a database.</p>
                        <p>DCL is an important aspect of database security, ensuring that data remains protected and
                            only authorised users have the necessary privileges.</p>
                        <p>There are two main DCL commands in SQL: GRANT & REVOKE.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>GRANT:</b> The GRANT command is used to provide specific priviliges or permissions
                                    to users or roles. Privileges can include the ability to perform various actions on
                                    tables, views, procedures, and other database objects.</p>
                                <p>Syntax- GRANT privilege_type ON object_name TO user_or_role;</p>
                                <p>In this Syntax:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>privilege_type refers to the specific privilege or permission being granted
                                        (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).</li>
                                    <LI>object_name is the name of the database object (e.g., table, view) to which the
                                        privilege is being granted.</LI>
                                    <li>user_or_role is the name of the user or role that is being granted the
                                        privilege.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Example- Granting SELECT privilege on a table named "Employees" to a user named
                                    "Analyst":</p>
                                <p>GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO Analyst;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>REVOKE:</b> The REVOKE command is used to remove or revoke specific privileges or
                                    permissions that have been previously granted to users or roles.</p>
                                <p>Syntax- REVOKE privilege_type ON object_name FROM user_or_role;</p>
                                <p>In this syntax:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>privilege_type is the privilege or permission being revoked.</li>
                                    <li>object_name is the name of the database object from which the privilege is being
                                        revoked.</li>
                                    <li>user_or_role is the name of the user or role from which the privilege is being
                                        revoked.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Example- Revoking the SELECT privilege on the "Employees" table from the "Analyst"
                                    user:</p>
                                <p>REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM Analyst;</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>TCL:</b> TCL stands for Transaction Control Language deals with the management of the
                            transactions within a database.</p>
                        <p>TCL commands are used to control the initiation, execution, and termination of transactions,
                            which are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are executed as
                            a single unit of work.</p>
                        <p>Transactions ensure data Consistency, integrity, and reliability in a database by grouping
                            related operations together and either committing or rolling back changes based on the
                            success or failures of those operations.</p>
                        <p>There are three main TCL commands in SQL: "COMMIT", "ROLLBACK", and "SAVEPOINT".</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>COMMIT:</b> The COMMIT command is used to permanently save the changes made during a
                                transaction.
                                <p>It makes all the changes applied to the database since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK
                                    command permanent.</p>
                                <p>Once a COMMIT is executed, the transaction is considered successful, and the changes
                                    are made permanent.</p>
                                <p>Example- Committing changes made during a transaction:</p>
                                <p>UPDATE Employees SET Salary=Salary*1.10 WHERE Department='Sales';</p>
                                <p>COMMIT;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>ROLLBACK:</b> The ROLLBACK command is used to undo changes made during a transaction.
                                It reverts all the changes applied to the database since the transaction began.
                                <p>ROLLBACK is typically used when an error occurs during the execution of a
                                    transaction, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.</p>
                                <p>Example: Rolling back changes due to an error during a transaction:</p>
                                <p>BEGIN;</p>
                                <P>UPDATE inventory SET Quantity=Quantity-10 WHERE ProductID=101;</P>
                                <p>--An error occurs here</p>
                                <p>ROLLBACK;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>SAVEPOINT:</b> The SAVEPOINT command creates a named point within a transaction,
                                allowing you to set a point to which you can later ROLLBACK If needed.
                                <p>SAVEPOINTs are useful when you want to undo part of a transaction while preserving
                                    other changes.</p>
                                <p>Syntax- SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;</p>
                                <p>Example- Using SAVINGPOINT to create a point within a transaction:</p>
                                <p>BEGIN;</p>
                                <P>UPDATE Accounts SET Balance=Balance-100 WHERE AccountID=123;</P>
                                <p>SAVEPOINT before_withdrawl;</p>
                                <p>UPDATE Accounts SET Balance=Balance + 100 WHERE AccountsID=456;</p>
                                <p>--An error occurs here</p>
                                <p>ROLLBACK TO before_withdrawl;</p>
                                <p>--The First update is still applied</p>
                                <p>COMMIT;</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <h5><u>TCL and Transaction Management:</u></h5>
                <p class="p-para">
                    Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands are vital for managing the integrity and consistency of
                    a database's data.</p>
                <p class="p-para">They allow you to group related changes into transactions, and in the event of errors,
                    either commit those changes or roll them back
                    to maintain data integrity.</p>
                <p class="p-para">TCL commands are used in combination with Data Manipulation Language(DML) and other
                    SQL commands to ensure that the database
                    remains in a reliable state despite unforeseen errors or issues.</p>
                <h5><u>DCL and Database Security:</u></h5>
                <p class="p-para"> DCL plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of a database system.
                </p>
                <p class="p-para"> By controlling access and permissions, DCL helps prevent unauthorised users from
                    tampering with or accessing sensitive data. Proper use of GRANT and REVOKE
                    commands ensures that only users who requires specific privileges can perform certain actions on
                    database objects.</p>
