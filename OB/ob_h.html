                    <p>We define a group has two or more individuals, interacting and interdependent, who have come
                        together to achieve particular common objectives. A group can range in size from two members to
                        thousands of members.</p>
                    <p> <b>R.M. Williams (1951)</b> “A social group is a given aggregate of people playing inter-related
                        roles and recognised by themselves or others as a unit of interaction.”</p>
                    <p><b>R.M. MacIver (1953)</b> “By group we mean any collection of social beings who enter into
                        distinctive social relationships with one another.”</p>
                    <p><b>Kretch, Crutchfield and Ballachy (1962)</b> defined psychological group “ as two or more
                        persons who meet the following conditions : (i) the relations among the members are independent,
                        each member’s behaviour influences the behaviour of each of the others, (ii) the members ‘share
                        on ideology’ – a set of beliefs, values and norms which regulate their mutual conduct.”</p>
                    <p><b>Paulus (1989)</b> “ A group consists of two or more interacting persons who share common
                        goals, have a stable relationship, are somehow interdependent and perceive that they are in fact
                        part of a group.”</p>
                    <p>There are two types of Group :</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Formal Group : </span>Formal workgroups are created by the organisation to achieve
                            organisational goals. These groups are defined based on certain parameters or the boundaries
                            in a formal way e.g. Sales Department, HR department, South region etc. Formal groups may
                            take the form of command groups, task groups, and functional groups.
                            <ul>
                                <li><span>Control Group : </span>Control Group means the group which is under the
                                    responsibility of a manager and the individuals account before the manager only.
                                </li>
                                <li><span>Task Group : </span>Task Group means the group which is formed in order to

                                <li><span>Function Group : </span>Functional group is generally created by the
                                    organisation to accomplish specific goals within an unspecified time frame.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Informal Group : </span> An Informal group is neither formally structured nor
                            organisationally determined or defined. Informal groups are natural formations in the work
                            environment that appears in response to the need for social contact.
                            <ul>

                                    common characteristics. Friendship groups are formed by members who enjoy
                                    similar social activities, political beliefs, religious values, or other common
                                    bonds.</li>

                    <p>It was founded by kurt Lewin to study group decision, group productivity, group interaction,
                        group cohesiveness and group communication. the Underlying assumption was that the laws of the
                        group behaviour can be established independently of the structure of the group.</p>
                    <p>Group Dynamic contain two terms : <b>Group and Dynamic</b>. Group is basically a collectivity of
                        two or more person. Dynamics comes from Greek work meaning <b>FORCE</b>. <br>
                        Thus, "Group dynamic is concerned with the interactions of forces among group members in a
                        social situation."
                    <p>
                    <h5 class="h2-head" id="e"> Characteristics of Group Dynamics</h5>
                    <p> The important characteristics of group dynamics are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Perception : </span>Group dynamics are defined by perception implies that every member
                            of the group is aware of his respective relationship with others.</li>
                        <li><span>Motivation : </span>Members join groups because they expect that the group will solve
                            their problems. they want progress and promotion which are achieved throigh group
                            performance.</li>
                        <li><span>Group Goals : </span>Group goal are targets towards which input, process and output
                            are directed.</li>
                        <li><span>Group Organisation : </span>Group is an Organisation which is composed of different
                            organs to attain certain objectives. A group has the structural elements of an effective
                            organisation. </li>
                        <li><span>Interdependency : </span> The main feature of a group is the members's interdepedence.
                            The members of a group may have a common goal but they may not be a part of the group
                            because they are not interdependent.</li>
                        <li><span>Interaction : </span>Members of a group must interact with each other. If they are
                            interdependent but do not interact, the group's goals are not achieved. Members have an
                            interpersonal problem-solving mode.</li>

                <h5 class="h2-head" id="f">Stages of Group Development</h5>
                <p>According to Tuckman’s theory, there are five stages of group development: forming, storming,
                    norming, performing, and adjourning. During these stages group, members must address several issues
                    and the way in which these issues are resolved determines whether the group will succeed in
                    accomplishing its tasks.</p>
                <img src="./imgs/group .jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Forming : </span>The first stage, Forming stage, faces a great amount of uncertainty about
                        the group’s purpose, structure, and leadership amongst the members of the group. Members “test
                        the waters” to determine what types of behaviours are acceptable. This stage is complete when
                        members have begun to think of themselves as part of a group.</li>
                    <li><span>Storming : </span>The Storming stage is one of intra-group conflict. Members accept the
                        existence of the group but resist the constraints it imposes on individuality. There is conflict
                        over who will control the group. When this stage is complete, there will be a relatively clear
                        hierarchy of leadership within the group.</li>
                    <li><span>Norming : </span>In the norming stage of group development, the team has effectively
                        resolved most, if not all, conflicts and can productively work on the project or towards the end
                        goal.</li>
                    <li><span>Performing : </span>The fourth stage is Performing. The structure at this point is fully
                        functional and accepted. Group energy has moved from getting to know and understand each other
                        to perform the task at hand. </li>
                    <li><span>Adjourning : </span>However, for temporary committees, teams, task forces, and similar
                        groups that have a limited task to perform, the Adjourning stage is for wrapping up activities
                        and preparing to disband.</li>

                <p>Group decision making(also known as collaboratives decision making) is a situation faced when

                        <ul>
                            <li>Originally adopted by Alex Osborn in 1938 in an American Company.</li>
                            <li>According to him, Brainstorming means using the brain to storm the problem.</li>
                            <li>Four basic Guidelines:

                                    <li>Generate as many ideas as possible.</li>
                                    <li>Be creative, freewheeling, & imaginative.</li>
                                    <li>Build upon piggybank, extend or combine earlier ideas.</li>
                                    <li>withhold criticism of other's ideas.</li>

                                    <li>All present their ideas in a round-robin procedure.</li>
                                    <li>Brief time is alloted to clarify ideas, after the presentation by all.</li>
                                    <li>Group members individually rank their preferences for the best alternatives by
                                        secret ballot.</li>
                                    <li>Group decision is announced based on this ranking.</li>
