                    <li><span>Attention : </span>Stimuli are selectively attended to by people. some of the stimuli are reacted to while others are ignored without being paid any attention. The stimuli that are paid attention depend purely on the people's selection capacity and the intensity of stimuli.</li>
                    <li><span>Recognition : </span>After paying attention to the stimuli, the employees try to recognize whether the stimuli are worth realizing. The messages  or incoming stimuli are recognized before they are transmitted into behaviour.</li>
                    <li><span>Translation : </span>The stimuli are evaluated before being converted into action or behaviour. The evaluation process is translation.</li>
                    <li><span>Behaviour : </span>Behaviour of employees depends on perception which is visible in the form of action, reaction or other behaviour. The Behavioural termination of perception may be overt or covert.</li>
                    <li><span>Performance : </span>Proper behaviour leads to higher performance. High performers become a source of stimuli and motivation to other employees.</li>
                    <li><span>Satisfaction : </span>High Perfomance gives more satisfaction. The level of satisfaction is calculated with the difference in perfomance and expectation. If the perfomance is more than expectation, people are delighted , but when performance is equal to expectation, it results in satisfaction.
