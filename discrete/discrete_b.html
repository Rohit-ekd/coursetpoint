                    <p class="p-para">Boolean Algebra is an algebra of logic. One of the 
                    earliest investigators of symbolic logic was George Boole(1815-1864) who
                    invented a systematic way of manipulating logic symbols which became known 
                    as Boolean Algebra. Till 1939, there was no practical application of Boolean 
                    algebra. In 1938 Shanon's work gave an Idea that Boolean Algebra could be 
                    applied to digital electronics. Indeed, it has become now an indispensable 
                    tool to computer scientists because of its direct applicability to switching 
                    theory and the logical design of digital coputers. </p>
                    <p class="p-para">Although the symbol 0 and 1 used in this tutorial look 
                        like the binary numbers, they are not. They do not represent any numerical 
                        values. They only have logical significance.</p>

                    <h5 class="h2-head" id="b">Truth Functions:</h5>
                    <P class="p-para">A truth function is a function that accepts truth values as 
                        input and produce a unique truth value as output. In other words, The input 
                        and output of a truth function are all truth values. A truth function will
                        always output exactly one truth value, and inputting the same truth values
                        will always output the same truth value. For example, In propositional logic, 
                        wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected 
                        by logical connectives.</P>
                    <p class="p-para">Classical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every 
                        statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical 
                        connectives is truth functional, thus every compound statement is a truth 
                        function. On the other side, modal logic is non-truth functional.</p>
