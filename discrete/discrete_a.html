                    is either true or false, but not both. For example,"Three plus three equals six"
                    and "Three plus three equals seven" are both statements the first because
                    it is true and the second because it is false. Similarly "x+y>1" is not 
                    a statement because for some values for x and y the sentence is true, whereas 
                    for others it is false. For instance, if x=1 and y=2, the sentence is true, 
                    if x=-3 and y=1, this is false. The truth or falsity of a statement is called 
                    its truth value. </p>

                <p class="p-para">If p is any proposition, the negation of p, denoted by
                    ~p and read as not p, is a statement which is false when p is true and 
                    true when p is false. Consider the statement- 
                    <br>p: Paris is in France.
                    <br>Then the negation of p is the statement 
                    <br>~p: Paris is not in France.
                    <br>Strictly speaking, not is not a connective, since it does not join 
                    two statements and ~p is not really a compound statement. However, not is a 
                    unary operation for the collection of statements, and ~p is a statement if p is 
                    considered a statement.

                <h5 class="h2-head">Conjuction:</h5>
                <p class="p-para">If p and q are two statements, then conjuction of p and q

                    statement p^q is true when both p and q are true, otherwise it is false. 
                    Example-
                    <br>p: Ram is healthy      
                    <br>q: He has blue eyes

                <p class="p-para">If p and q are two statements, the disjunction of p and q is 
                    the compound statement denoted by p∨q and reads as "p or q". The statement p∨q 
                    is true if at least one of p or q is true. It is false when both p and q are 
                    false.</p>

                    represents the conclusion (or consequent). It's often denoted as p->q. 
                    The statement p->q means that if the hypothesis p is true, then the conclusion 
                    q must also be true. However, if p is false, then the truth value of q doesn't

                <h5 class="h2-head" id="d">Duality:</h5>
                <p class="p-para">Given a boolean expression, the dual is formed by replacing AND 
                    with OR, OR with AND, 0 with 1, and 1 with 0. Variables and complements are 
                    left interchanged. This rule for forming the dual can be summerized as follows:
                 <br>[f(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>,....., X<sub>n</sub>, 0, 1, + , .)]<sup>D</sup> = f(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...... X<sub>n</sub>, 1, 0, . , +)
                 <br>This important property of changing operations and identity elements in 
                 Boolean algebra is known as <b>duality principle</b>. This ensures that if a 
                    theorem is proved based on the axioms of the Boolean Algebra, then a dual 
                    theorem obtained by interchanging + with . and 0 with 1 automatically holds. 
                    Axioms and basic theorems are divided into two parts (a) and (b), one part 
                    may be obtained by other by using duality principle.

                <h5 class="h2-head">Normal Forms:</h5>
                <p class="p-para">By comparing truth tables, one determine whether two logical 
                    expression P and Q are equivalent. But the process is very tedious when the 
                    number of variables increases. A better method is to transform the expressions 
                    P and Q to some standard forms of expressions P' and Q' such that a simple 
                    comparision of P' and Q' shows whether P=Q, The standard forms are called 
                    Normal Forms or Cononical Forms. These are two types of Normal form; 
                    Disjunctive normal form and Conjuctive normal form.</p>

                    and their negations is called an elementary sum. For example, p∨q, p∨~q, 
                    ~p∨~q are elementary sums in two variables.</p>
                <p class="p-para">A logical expression is said to be in disjunctive form 
                    if it is the sum of elementary products. For example, p∨(q^r) and p∨(~q^r)

                    form.
