                <p class="p-para">Mathematics is broadly divided into two major branches -the discrete
                    mathematics and continuous mathematics. Discrete mathematics mostly deals with only
                    those real numbers which are multiple os some basic unit. If the basic unit is 1, then
                    the discrete variable can assume only integral values. Discrete mathematics is a rapidly
                    growing and increasingly used area of mathematics with many practical and relevant
                    applications.</p>

                        Logic which which uses a symbolic language to express its principles in precise
                        and unambiguous terms is known as mathematical logic. Mathematical logic has
                        become an accepted part of discrete mathematics. One reason for this is that all
                        efforts at the verification of algorithms inevitably the notation and methods of
                        logic.

                <p class="p-para">Binary logic deals with variables that take on two discrete values
                    (like 1 or 0, True or False) and with operations that assume logical meaning.
                    To build digital logic circuits of various families for different operations, the
                    basic electronic circuits that are used are inverters and gates. Boolean Algebra is
                    a simple and systematic way of representing and performing the operations of logic
                    circuits in modern digital systems. The problem of optimizing the design of these
                    circuits is essentially a problem of Boolean algebra. </p>

                    or nodes) in space that are interconnected by a set of lines (called edges).
                    Graph theory is one of the most important branches of discrete mathematics
                    and a source of many algorithms of practical importance. Among all the discrete
                    structures, graphs are the most flexible and adaptable to suit the needs of
                    applications. It has uses in areas such as syntactic analysis, fault detection
                    and diagnosis in computers, and minimal path problems.

                <p class="p-para">The concept of a relation is a basic concept in computer science
                    as well as in real life. This concept arises when we consider a pair of objects
                    and compare one another. A relational database stores information linking attributes
                    of some set of individuals as a family of n-tuples for some n. Standard examples are
                    database of airline booking or a medical histories and diagnoses of hospital
                    patients.</p>
                <p class="p-para">One of the important concepts in discrete mathematics
                    is that of function. The term "map", "mapping", "transformation", and
                    many other mean the same thing. Relation in mathematics describe connections
                    between different elements of the same set, whereas functions describe
                    connections between two different sets.
