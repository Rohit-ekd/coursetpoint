                    ActiveX components are small program module used primarily in Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser to add features and functionality. These components can be used for various purposes. There are different technology components.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>COM: </span>ActiveX is based on COM, Which provide a way for software components to interact with each other.</li>
                        <li><span>OLE: </span>ActiveX adapts OLE technology for embedding and linking conent.</li>
                        <li><span>ActiveX Controls: </span>These are reusable software components that can be embedded in applications or web pages.</li>

                    In practice, Java and ActiveX Operate in different environments and have different models for handling component and security.

                <p class="p-para">An ActiveX control is similar to a Java Applet. Unlike Java Applets, however ActiveX controls have full access to the window Operating System. This gives them much more power than Java Applets, but with this power comes a certain risk that the applet may damage the software or data on your machine.</p>
                <h5 class="h2-head">How do ActiveX controls work?</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>ActiveX's controls are typically used to provide interfaces of data and application.</li>
                    <li>For Example, One of the most common uses is to host a visualization contols that display a document on a webpages, where the document is normally represented in an HTML file.</li>
                    <li>When you want to previewer print the document, you use it from with your browser.</li>

                    <li><span>ActiceX Container: </span> A program that can accept activeX control or document Object.</li>
                    <li><span>ActiveX Server: </span>A DDL or other executable program that provides the services of one or more ActiveX Components.</li>

                <p class="p-para">There are various types of controls are used in window environments and are often embedded in web pages or used in desktop applications.</p>

                <p class="p-para">ASP Stands for Active server Pages and it is a server side script engine for building web pages. ASP basically a server page that contains embedded programs in it. The ASP server side engine basically perform the tasks of reading executing the ASP file and then return the file to the browser.</p>

<h5 class="h2-head">Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
    <li><span>user control: </span> The creation of user control supports the making of reusable components.</li>
    <li><span>custom control: </span>We can make custom controls from ASP, here the code is compiled into a Dynamic link Library file.</li>
    <li><span>Rendering Technique: </span>ASP uses visited composite rendering technique in which composite tree is build.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="h2-head">Advantages:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>ASP reduce line of code for build the complex and large software.</li>
    <li>It has smart caching technique.</li>
    <li>ASP is much faster than other application.</li>
    <li>ASP is widely used in this modern era.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="h2-head">Disadvantages:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>There is a set of complexity in pages and there are many pages and there are many performance issues.</li>
    <li>It is limited development and bugging tools.</li>
    <li>There is no real state management in ASP.</li>
