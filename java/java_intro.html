                    <p class="p-para">
                        Java is an Object Oriented Programming Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystem in 1995.
                        Java
                        was officially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Since then, it has been further developed and
                        maintained by Oracle Corporation, which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. Java is Platform Independent
                        Language used to developed Android development, web development, artificial intelligence, cloud
                        applications, and much more.

                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Simple:</span> Java was designed to be easy for the programmers to learn and use effectively.
                            If you already understand the basic concept of object oriented programming, learing java will even
                            easier.</li>
                        <li><span>Object Oriented: </span>In starting we can say java is pure OOP, Everything in java is an
                            Object. It simplifies software developement and maintained. The Object model in java is simple and
                            easy to extend, while primitive type, such as integers, are kept as high performance nonobject.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Object</li>
                                <li>Class</li>
                                <li>Inheritance</li>
                                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                                <li>Encapsulation</li>
                                <li>Data Abstraction</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Platform Independent: </span>Java is platform Independent means other languages like c/c++ are
                            machine and platform dependent where java is platform dependent that means code of java run on
                            different platform like windows ,mac and linux gives the same output.</li>
                        <li><span>Secured: </span>Java is best known for his Security with java we can developed virus free
                            software such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bytecode verification</li>
                                <li>Limited use of Pointer</li>
                                <li>Virtual Machine Sandbox</li>
                                <li>Automatic Memory management</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Robust: </span>Java is also called Robust Programming Language. But why java is Robust
                            Programming language due to following reasons are given below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Robust means Reliable and Stable , java is stable and reliable and strong type checking.
                                </li>
                                <li>Due to Strong Memory Management.</li>
                                <li>Java handles exceptions easy compare to other Programming.</li>
                                <li>Java programs making less prone to crashes and errors.</li>
                                <li>Automatic garbage collection facility provide by java.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Portable: </span> Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the java byte code to
                            any platform. It does not required any other implementation.</li>
                        <li><span>Rich Standard Library: </span> Java provides a vast standard library (Java API) that offers a
                            wide range of pre-built classes and methods for common programming tasks. This library simplifies
                            development by providing ready-to-use components for tasks such as file I/O, networking, GUI
                            development, and more.</li>
                        <li><span>Multithreaded: </span> Java supports multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of
                            multiple threads within a single program.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li><span>class:</span>Basically class is a container that contain data member and method. A class is a

                        <li><span>public: </span>Public is a keyword that an access modifier represent visibility. Its mean when
                            class is public it is visible to all.</li>
                        <li><span>static: </span>static is also a keyword. If we declare any method is static we should not need
                            to create an object of that class that is known as static methos. </li>
                        <li><span>void: </span>void is return type of the method. It mean it doesn't return any value when you
                            declare a method as void.</li>
                        <li><span>main: </span>As the name suggest it represent the starting point of the program. main() method
                            is entry point of the java program.</li>
                        <li><span>String []args / String args[]: </span> It is a parameter that represents an array of strings
                            passed to the 'main()' method when a java program is executed from the command line.</li>
                        <li><span>System.Out.println(): </span>It is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, Out is an
                            object of the printStream class, println() is a method of the printStream class.</li>
