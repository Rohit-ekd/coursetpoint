                    Messaging is a method of communication between software components or applications. A messaging system
                    is a peer-to-peer facility: A messaging client can send messages to, and receive messages from, any
                    other client. Each client connects to a messaging agent that provides facilities for creating, sending,
                    receiving, and reading messages. <br />
                    The Java Message Service is a Java API that allows applications to create, send, receive, and read
                    messages. Designed by Sun and several partner companies, the JMS API defines a common set of interfaces
                    and associated semantics that allow programs written in the Java programming language to communicate
                    with other messaging implementations.
